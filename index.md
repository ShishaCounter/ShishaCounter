<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
<p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
<p><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a></p>
<p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.</p>
<p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
<p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>
<p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>
<p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,</a></p>

The add-on informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.</p>

<h4>Google AdWords with Conversion Tracking</h4>
<p>Our website uses Google AdWords and conversion tracking. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>

<p>If you click on an ad placed by Google, the conversion tracking we use stores a cookie on your device. These so-called conversion cookies expire after 30 days and do not otherwise identify you personally.</p>
<p>If the cookie is still valid and you visit a specific page of our website, both we and Google can evaluate that you clicked on one of our ads placed on Google and that you were then forwarded to our website.</p>

In addition, we receive information about the number of users who clicked on our advertisement(s) as well as about the pages on our site that are subsequently visited. Neither we nor third parties who also use Google AdWords will be able to identify you from this conversion tracking.</p>
<p>You can also prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored.
